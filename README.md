# ELeFHAnt
Ensemble Learning for Harmonization and Annotation of Single Cells (ELeFHAnt) provides an easy to use R package for users to annotate clusters of single cells, harmonize labels across single cell datasets to generate a unified atlas and infer relationship among celltypes between two datasets. It provides users with the flexibility of choosing a single machine learning based classifier or letting ELeFHAnt automatically use the power of  randomForest and SVM (Support Vector Machines) to make predictions. It has three functions 1) CelltypeAnnotation 2) LabelHarmonization 3) DeduceRelationship.

## ELeFHAnt Model
![Graph](ELeFHAnt.png)

## Random Forest
Random Forests is a powerful tool used extensively across a multitude of fields. It is based on generating a large number of decision trees, each constructed using a different subset of your training set. These subsets are usually selected by sampling at random and with replacement from the original data set. The decision trees are then used to identify a classification consensus by selecting the most common output.

## SVM (Support Vector Machines)
SVM is a well-established supervised machine learning algorithm. It finds a hyperplane that separates data points into classes, where training occurs through “maximizing the margin”. Training time tends to be longer as data increases. SVM was ranked highly for cell annotation when benchmarked against other tools.

## Ensemble Learning
ELeFHAnt provides users the ability to use ensemble learning for classifying celltypes for un-annotated datasets. In this mode ELeFHAnt uses the classification accuracy of both Random forest and SVM. It does so by assigning weights (accuracy while learning) to the predictions from each classifier. Weighted confusion matrices from each classifier are normalized based on highest number of cells shared among celltypes and assigned clusters, which are then added together to make the final ensemble predictions.

## Celltype Annotation Function
Celltype annotation is a function used to annotate celltypes in single cell datasets. It requires a reference dataset (a processed h5ad object with Celltypes in metadata) and a query dataset (a processed h5ad object with Clusters in metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classification methods to learn celltypes from the reference dataset and then predict celltypes for query dataset.

## Label Harmonization Function
Label Harmonization is a function used to harmonize cell labels (celltypes) across single cell datasets. It requires a list of processed h5ad objects with a Celltypes column in metadata or an integrated h5ad object (with Celltypes and Clusters in the metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods.

## Deduce Relationship Function
Deduce Relationship is a function used to infer the similarity between celltypes across single cell datasets. The output is a heatmap that shows which celltype in one reference best corresponds to a celltype in another reference. It requires two reference datasets (both processed h5ad objects with Celltypes in the metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods.

# Celltype Annotation in detail
Celltype annotation is a function to annotate celltypes in single cell datasets.

## Requirements
It requires a reference dataset (a processed h5adbject with Celltypes in the metadata) and a query dataset (a processed h5ad object with Clusters in the metadata). One can choose from randomForest, SVM or Ensemble classifiction methods to learn celltypes from the reference dataset and then predict celltypes for the query dataset.

## How does the function work?
### Merge Reference and Query
Merge reference and query into a single object.
### Normalization
Run Log2 Normalization on the merged object.
### Feature Selection
Obtain highly variable features from the merged data  (default: 2000).
### Scaling
Scale the merged object for highly variable features.
### Generate train and test data
Training set is the reference data with celltypes extracted from scaled data. Test set is the query data with Clusters extracted from scaled data.
### Train Classifiers
Training data is used for training randomForest and SVM classifiers.
### Predict Celltypes
Each classifier after training is then used to classify cell types for the test data.
### Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning based classsification uses both randomForest and SVM predictions to define final predictions. It does that by assigning weights (the accuracy while learning) to the predictions from each classifier. Weighted confusion matrices from each classifier are normalized based on highest number of cells shared among celltypes and assigned clusters, which are then added together to make the final ensemble predictions.

## How to use the function?

classification_method: choose classification method for learning and predicting celltypes. randomForest (decision trees), SVM (Support Vector Machines) or Ensemble (uses estimation robustness of both randomForest and SVM to predict)

crossvalidationSVM: if a integer value k>0 is specified, a k-fold cross validation on the training data is performed to assess the quality of the model

validatePredictions: logical indicator (True or False) to assess predictions by computing number of markers shared between assigned celltype and annotated cluster
